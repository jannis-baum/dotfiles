# My personal config

Here is where I try to keep all configuration of all the tools I use. This is
not intended to be used by anyone else in its entirety, but might be nice to
look at for reference.

## Most important tools (aside from `git`)

- [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) terminal & as a `tmux`-replacement
  for working locally (tmux has horrible performance)
- [zsh](https://www.zsh.org) as a shell
- [vim♥️](https://www.vim.org) as an editor with
  [CoC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) for powerful completion & language
  support
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) with
  [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd),
  [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) &
  [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) for file management & fuzzy finding
